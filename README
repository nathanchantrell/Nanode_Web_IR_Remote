Allows operation of an infrared controlled device using a web browser.

More information on my blog at http://nathan.chantrell.net/20120119/building-a-web-based-infrared-remote-control/

Uses the IRremote library from http://www.arcfn.com/2009/08/multi-protocol-infrared-remote-library.html

Web server code heavily based on the EtherCard version of RESTduino by Andrew D Lindsay

The optional file webremote.css can be placed on a separate webserver to prettify the output a bit, including this in the Nanode sketch would push it over the RAM limit unfortunately.
Alternatively you could build a full fat interface on a separate webserver and just call the Nanode URLs to send the IR command.
